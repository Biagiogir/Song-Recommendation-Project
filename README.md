# Song-Recommendation-Project

**Authors:** Biagio Girlando; Lok Ming Bosco Au-Yeung

**Objective:** In this project, a Spotify Song Recommender has been built from scratch. The project involved web Scraping to obtain a so called "hot songs" database (Billboard Top 100) and the use of Spotify API to build a diverse database with songs of many genres. This Spotify Database has been used to develop a kmeans clustering model and ultimately an audio features based song recommender.

**Tools used:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup), Spotify API, sklearn

**Aproach:**

- First Prototype (Hot Song Recommender):

This first prototype only includes the hot song recommender. The flow chart of the recommender is as in the image below.

- Second Prototype:

The second and final prototype includes the hot song recommender and the audio features based recommender. The flow chart of the program is as in the image below.
